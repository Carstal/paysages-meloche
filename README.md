# Lessons Learned & Things I Would Change
## Project Planning
A lot of components were identified and worked on, but I think limiting the number of components and focusing on the quality and functions of the products delivered would have been a better choice in the long run for this project.
## Scope
The scope of this project was too narrow and created bottlenecks after completion.
Focusing on delivering a standalone product to a single client led to constraints with the data models and the database.
This simply diminishes the value of further working on this project.
Increasing the scope of this project would have benefitted this project greatly to creating additional value and increasing the quality of the product by focusing on scalability during the planning stage.
## Performance
Performance is a major issue for this product. As we were both new to working with Next.js, the product is rough and slow.
As a user, you want a product to feel good when you use it. You don't want to wait for simple things to happen when using an application and you want to know that things are happening.
A lot of the blame has to do with inexperience and inefficent code being written to create a working product.
## UX/UI
There is too much of a focus on using the company's colour scheme across the entire application.
A lot of the work was attributed to functionality and not presentation, but setting up global styling for common elements at the start would have greatly benefitted both visibility and legibility of elements.
Small common animations/interactions should have been created to let the user know that things are happening in the background while they wait to improve the user experience.
